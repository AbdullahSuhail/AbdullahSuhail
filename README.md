# Hi there! 👋

## Hi there! I'm **Abdullah Suhail** 👨‍💻

I'm a passionate developer focused on building practical projects with Python and JavaScript ecosystems. I love learning about large language models, web scraping, and full-stack web development. 🚀
 



#### About Me

- Name: **Abdullah Suhail**
 

I build small-to-medium projects to learn and demonstrate concepts in web development, machine learning, and LLM experimentation. My recent work includes a Django blog platform, LLM-focused tutorials, web scraping notebooks, and image search experiments. I'm open to collaboration and always learning new tools and best practices.  

Currently Learning / Working On:

- Exploring practical applications of LLMs and prompt workflows (LLMs-Tuts) with future goal of learning RAG.
- System Design and architecture 
- Building full-stack web apps with Django and modern frontend tooling
